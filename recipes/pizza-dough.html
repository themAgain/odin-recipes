    <h3>themAgain's Pizza Dough</h3>
    <p>This is a proper pizzeria recipe. The dough should be slightly firm and easy to stretch. If you find the dough isn't coming out quite the way you'd like it, try experimenting with different types of flour. It should also be mentioned that the amount of water you use is incredibly important. Just the slightest bit too much, and you'll be working with a gooey batch that just doesn't cooperate.</p>
    <p>Note: This recipe requires a heavy duty mixer if proportions are not cut drastically.</p>
